Tucker,On Oct. 24; 2012; plaintiff James Davies was driving a 1988 Nissan pickup truck on northbound Interstate 75. Plaintiff Brenda Young was a passenger in Davies' vehicle. Defendant Andrew Wright; within the course and scope of his employment with defendant B&W Cartage Inc.; was operating a tractor-trailer owned by Steve Campbell d/b/a Steve Campbell Trucking; and was traveling directly behind Davies' vehicle. Traffic became congested as Davies and Wright entered a construction zone in Montgomery County. Davies slowed his vehicle to accommodate for the congestion and was rear-ended by Wright. Both Davies and Young were injured in the accident.    Davies and Young sued Wright; B&W and Campbell d/b/a Steve Campbell Trucking for motor vehicle negligence. They claimed that Wright was negligent in the operation of the tractor-trailer and that his negligence proximately caused them to sustain bodily injuries. Davies also named his insurance carrier; Farmers Insurance; as a defendant.    Farmers Insurance had already paid Davies and Young $5;000 each pursuant to the medical payment provision of the policy. The company asserted a cross-claim against Davies and Wright seeking subrogation of the monies paid.    The claims against Wright and Campbell d/b/a Steve Campbell Trucking were voluntarily dismissed. The final defendant; B&W Cartage; Inc.; stipulated to liability. The only issue remaining before the court was the nature and severity of plaintiffs' alleged bodily injuries.,Both plaintiffs were transported to the emergency room via ambulance. Davies was treated for minor injuries and released. He followed up with a visit to his family care physician and received chiropractic care for approximately six months following the collision. Davies sought damages of $17685 for past medical expenses plus compensation for his pain and suffering.    Young's injuries were more serious. She sustained a compression fracture of her thoracic spine as well as injuries to her head shoulder back and neck. She received follow-up care with an orthopedic specialist and chiropractic care. During the course of treatment Young underwent MRIs and X-rays of her mid and lower back.    B&W Cartage disputed the nature and severity of the injuries claimed.,11/1/2013,11,1,2013,0

Russo,On October 31; 2006; plaintiff Kenneth McQueen; 42; was riding his bicycle eastbound on a sidewalk on the north side of Lorain Road in North Olmsted. At the same time; Daniel Greulich was traveling southbound on an adjacent commercial driveway that intersected with Lorain Road.    Greulich reportedly continued along the commercial driveway until he reached Lorain Road; when he stopped at the end of the driveway; McQueen's bicycle collided with the side of Greulich's vehicle. McQueen was thrown from his bike and claimed he sustained a mid-back disc herniation; among other injuries; as a result of the accident.    McQueen sued Greulich; claiming that Greulich had negligently failed to exercise caution as he approached the sidewalk; so as to ensure the safety of oncoming pedestrians and/or bicyclists.    McQueen's counsel argued that although the driveway crossed over the sidewalk; Greulich should have stopped and looked before crossing the sidewalk. His failure to do so; it was argued; created a sudden emergency for McQueen.    McQueen testified that there was only a split second between the time he saw Greulich's vehicle and the time he collided with the passenger's side of the vehicle.    Greulich denied liability; arguing that the collision was the result of McQueen's negligence. Defense counsel maintained that McQueen should have been prepared to yield the right of way at the driveway; and that he had had the last clear chance to avoid the collision.,McQueen was taken to an urgent-care center immediately following the accident with complaints of neck and back pain as well as various abrasions and contusions. Two weeks later he presented to a chiropractic facility with additional complaints of dizziness numbness and tingling in his fingers loss of balance and insomnia. X-rays obtained at that time revealed no signs of fracture or dislocation. A possible nerve-root compression was suspected.    McQueen continued to experience significant pain he claimed and he presented for additional testing in 2007. Studies obtained at that time revealed a herniation at T7-8 with significant stenosis and foraminal narrowing. A follow-up myelogram and CT indicted multi-level disc protrusions with nerve-root compression. Surgical repair was recommended.    McQueen's suit sought $20293.64 in damages for past medical expenses as well as unspecified amounts of damages for future medical expenses and lost wages; he claimed to have lost his job due to his inability to perform the duties required and that he was unable to obtain employment due to the lasting pain from his injuries.    Defense counsel disputed the proximate cause of McQueen's complained-of injuries suggesting that these injuries were not caused in the accident with Greulich but were instead the result of a combination of events that occurred both prior to and after the accident.,9/1/2013,9,1,2013,0

Kestranek; 50; owner of a moving business; was operating his vehicle in the township of Freedom in Portage County. Defendant Kevin P. Crosby; who was traveling in the opposite direction; crossed the center line and struck Kestranek's vehicle head-on. The accident 23 a.m. Kestranek claimed orthopedic fractures as a result of the accident.    Raymond Kestranek and his wife; Nadine Kestranek; sued Crosby for motor vehicle negligence; and alleged that Crosby failed to maintain proper control of his vehicle. Defendant Ameritemps; Inc. n/k/a Extinct Temps; Inc. was Crosby's employer and was sued under respondeat superior and vicarious liability. Plaintiffs asserted that Crosby was in the course and scope of his employment at the time of the accident.    Defendants denied that Crosby was acting in the scope of his employment. They argued that Crosby was driving his own vehicle and was not being paid by Ameritemps at the time of the collision.,Raymond Kestranek was transported to an emergency room where he was under the care of a level-one trauma team mainly for orthopedic injuries that consisted of a comminuted displaced pilon fracture of the right distal tibia three metatarsal fractures of the right foot a severe comminuted mid-shaft femur fracture radial styloid fracture of the right wrist which was minimally displaced and a minor avulsion fracture of the ulnar styloid. In addition to the fractures Kestranek claimed multiple contusions abrasions and head trauma. The wrist required casting and ultimately healed well.    Kestranek was hospitalized from the date of the accident until Oct. 26 2006 during which he underwent multiple surgeries. On the date of the accident doctors installed an external fixator to provide stability and length to the ankle which was removed on Dec. 14 2006. The ankle fracture was described as a severe longitudinal compression that involved gross disruption of the ankle joint. Eight days after the accident Kestranek underwent open reduction internal fixation via an anterior approach with buttress plating for the large anterolateral fragment of the distal tibia.    Also on the date of the accident Kestranek required trochanteric antigrade nailing of the left femur which required the insertion of an intramedullary rod along with bridging the comminuted fractures with locking screws to maintain rotation. This surgery was performed concurrently with the ankle/tibia surgery. Subsequent surgery was performed on Nov. 23 2006 to replace the titanium rod because of broken bolts.    Kestranek was readmitted to the hospital from Nov. 20 2006 through Nov. 24 2006 due to the development of a blood clot in his right calf. He was subsequently seen by an orthopedist on Dec. 1 2006. Although an X-ray at that time showed healing of the femur Kestranek was not allowed to bear weight because of the unstable nature of the fracture. On Feb. 9 2007 an X-ray of the femur showed increased healing with good range of motion of the knee. Kestranek then underwent physical therapy strengthening.    Kestranek claimed he developed compartment syndrome of the right foot and ankle necessitating a third ankle surgery. On Nov. 17 2010 he underwent complete ankle fusion.    He claimed a permanently altered gait and incurable back pain as a result of his injuries necessitating the use of daily pain medication. He also claimed the need for future surgery on his back. According to Kestranek he is unable to walk sit or stand for longer than 20 minutes.    Kestranek claimed he would be unable to return to work or find a job due to his disability. He further argued that he would need accommodations for his injuries. His wife sought damages for loss of consortium comfort and services.,9/1/2013,9,1,2013,0

Renick,On Dec. 26; 2008; Traci Reed; 40; and her family returned from a trip to Morgan County; where they had celebrated Christmas. Although they had made the trip to Morgan County in two cars; Traci's car had been left at her place of employment. The family stopped by the office to pick up the car. Traci was driving her vehicle home with her son Conner; 5; in the back seat and was following the vehicle driven by her husband; who had their daughter; Samantha; in his vehicle. They were traveling on State Route 83; a two-lane road with a 55-mph speed limit; when Traci was involved in an accident. Traci's husband; Michael; had seen Traci's headlights flicker in his rearview mirror and at some point noticed that Traci was no longer behind him; but assumed she had taken a shortcut. When he returned home with his daughter; he discovered that Traci and Conner were not there; so he and his daughter returned to SR 83; where they discovered that Traci's vehicle had struck or had been struck by a tree that had fallen into the roadway. Emergency personnel were already on the scene. Traci died as a result of injuries sustained in the accident. Conner suffered a skull fracture and a brain injury.    Plaintiff Michael Reed; as personal representative for Traci's estate and as next friend of Connor and Samantha Reed; filed a lawsuit against the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT). Plaintiff alleged that the ODOT had breached a duty owed to maintain its highways in a reasonably safe condition for the traveling public; including removal of dangerous trees in the road right-of-way.    A trooper who responded to the accident observed that a tree had fallen into the roadway and was blocking both the north and southbound lanes. An investigation indicated there was no evidence that Traci tried to stop before the accident and evidence suggested that Traci's vehicle was within the northbound lane as the tree was falling. Evidence also suggested that the tree fell from the east edge of the roadway and struck Traci's vehicle; which then traveled off the west edge of the roadway and struck a number of other trees and a fence before coming to a rest. The approximately 50-year-old red oak tree that fell on Traci's vehicle had reportedly stood with a substantial lean over the roadway for years before this accident; had dead limbs; was located in a sloped embankment with exposed roots and was within the state right-of-way; according to plaintiff.    Plaintiff asserted that ODOT crews maintained the area over the years; the condition of the tree existed for an extended period of time such that defendant had constructive notice and ODOT employees had previously noted the tree's dangerous leaning condition. Plaintiff argued there was no evidence of adverse weather conditions or any act of God that would have felled the tree. Finally; plaintiff argued that the defendant's negligence caused Traci's death and Conner's injuries.    Defendant contended it had no notice the tree was leaning or that it represented a dangerous condition. Defendant argued that; without proper notice; it had no duty to remove the tree. Defendant's arborist testified that the tree had a classic natural lean and had grown toward the sunlight. He maintained the tree was asymmetric; but there was no indication the tree was dead or distressed. He additionally testified that the tree had been growing normally and the tree's falling was not predictable.    Defendant contended that the property owner where the tree was located failed to exercise reasonable care by not removing the tree; but could not establish that the property owner had actual or constructive notice of the condition of the tree. Lastly; defendant maintained that the tree falling was an act of God.,Traci Reed died at the scene from blunt force trauma. Conner Reed was transported from the scene via ambulance to a nearby hospital where he was treated for a right frontal skull fracture and swelling of the brain. Conner was diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury (contusions and diffuse axonal injury). He claimed cognitive deficits including difficulties with his attention span ability to focus impulse control word retrieval and comprehension.,5/1/2013,5,1,2013,0

Both of these entities paid medical benefits on plaintiffs' behalf and were named to protect their subrogation rights. Defendant Ohio Casualty; the plaintiffs' underinsured motorist carrier; was also named in the lawsuit.    Defendants Borgert disputed liability; but the court granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs on that issue.,Stephen Smith suffered severe fractures of his right ankle which required three surgeries.

Shaver,On the afternoon of March 2; 2010; Chad Brotherson; mid-30s; was driving his pickup truck south on I-71 in Columbus. Jonathan Ambrose; who was in his early 20s; was a passenger in the truck. They were traveling under the East Hudson Bridge when a large chunk of concrete fell from the bridge and crashed through the windshield. Brotherson was able to maintain control of the truck and safely pulled off the road; despite being struck on the head by a portion of the concrete. Ambrose was also injured. He sustained rib and collarbone fractures; as well as a collapsed lung.    Brotherson and Ambrose sued the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) for negligence and negligence per se. They alleged that; although the bridge inspections for the past 10 years indicated spalling and excess concrete debris; the ODOT failed to remove the excess concrete and failed to make adequate repairs to the deteriorating structure to ensure the safety of motorists. Plaintiffs further argued that the inspection reports provided notice of the potential danger posed by the concrete and the ODOT knew; or should have known; that the deteriorating concrete posed an unreasonable danger to passing motorists in the southbound lanes of I-71. Plaintiffs asserted that the probability concrete would fall from the bridge into the southbound lanes of I-71 was thus reasonably foreseeable and preventable. According to plaintiffs; the ODOT negligently maintained; repaired and/or controlled the bridge and that the negligent acts by the ODOT directly and proximately caused their injuries. Plaintiffs argued that the ODOT's failure to make repairs to the bridge or otherwise make it safe breached both its common law duty of reasonable care; as well as its specific statutory duties to inspect; maintain and repair bridges under O.R.C. ?? 5501.11; ?? 5501.47; and other laws; constituting negligence per se or as a matter of law.    Defendant ODOT admitted it had a general duty to maintain the bridge in a reasonable safe manner to ensure public safety. However; it contended that it was not liable for damages caused by dangerous conditions unless it had actual or constructive notice of the precise condition alleged to have caused the injuries. Defendant argued that the spalling issue had been addressed and the excess concrete had been previously removed. Defendant further argued that maintenance was performed routinely and that the agency was covered by the public duty doctrine.,   Ambrose suffered a collarbone fracture two fractured ribs and a collapsed lung causing permanent pain suffering and disfigurement.    Brotherson sustained serious injuries to his neck back head right eye and other parts of his body. His injuries included a traumatic closed head injury with post-concussive syndrome. He claimed permanent pain suffering and disfigurement.    Both plaintiffs sought damages for past and future lost wages and employment benefits including loss of earning capacity. They also sought damages for loss of enjoyment of life permanent and substantial physical deformity and a permanent physical functional injury that permanently prevents them from being able to independently care for themselves and perform life-sustaining activities. Ambrose's wife and child sought damages for loss of consortium.    Defendant disputed proximate cause with regard to some or all of the injuries as well as the extent of the plaintiffs' damages.,4/1/2013,4,1,2013,0

Plaintiff alternatively argued that Patton caused and/or contributed to the accident. Plaintiff claimed orthopedic injuries; soft tissue injuries and road rash as a direct result of this accident. Her children sought damages for loss of consortium.    Defendant Patton contended that Frey caused this accident when she abruptly attempted to make a right turn after signaling her intention to make a left turn. Patton filed a cross-claim against Frey for injuries he sustained in the accident. Defendant Frey denied signaling a left turn. Instead; she argued that she had properly signaled her intention to make a right turn. She asserted that Patton was driving too close; failed to pay proper attention and failed to stop in time to avoid striking her car. Both defendants disputed the nature and extent of plaintiff's injuries; arguing that she had recovered and her claim for future damages was speculative.    Plaintiff was a 38-year-old single female who worked as a hairstylist.,   Back and pelvic fractures; soft tissue arm hip and wrist injuries; and road rash. Plaintiff required emergency room treatment followed by medical care. She mostly recovered but claimed some limitations as well as the likelihood of future arthritis.

Bates) and $30000 for future medical expenses plus damages for pain and suffering. His spouse Barbara A.

Hord had complaints of lower back pain. X-rays were performed; following which Hord was released with pain medication. The next day; Hord experienced paralysis to both legs; with increasing back pain. He was transported back to the Mercy facility. Further diagnostics revealed a spinal fracture and associated spinal cord injuries with distended bladder. Hord claimed the paralysis was due to a failure to properly interpret the X-rays taken on April 12.    Hord and his wife; Jean Hord; filed suit against Mercy Hospital Anderson; Mercy Health-Anderson Hospital; Mercy Health Partners; Mercy Health Partners of Southwest Ohio; emergency room physician Krista Varnell; M.D.; Varnell's employers Emergency Medicine Physicians; LLC and Emergency Medicine Physicians of Hamilton County; LTD;  and radiologist James Weber; M.D. and his employer; Anderson Radiology Associates; LLP. The lawsuit alleged medical malpractice. The only hospital defendant remaining at the time of trial was Mercy Hospital Anderson. The other hospital entities were dismissed.    Plaintiffs asserted that Dr. Weber misread the lumbar x-ray as inconclusive for any abnormalities and that Dr. Varnell was negligent in failing to diagnose the spinal fracture prior to discharging Hord; despite the fact that Hord was experiencing increasing back pain while in the emergency room. As a result; plaintiffs argued that Hord suffered permanent damage to his spinal cord.    Plaintiffs argued that defendants breached their duties by giving substandard care; failing to diagnose a spinal fracture; failing to investigate increasing and persistent back pain; and discharging the patient with an inaccurate diagnosis. Plaintiffs also alleged that the hospital and employers were vicariously liable.    Defendants denied liability. They contended that the injuries were a result of an event which occurred naturally and over which they had no control. Defendants argued that the injuries were the result of a pre-existing condition and/or pathology that any optimal medical or surgical intervention in the clinical course would not have prevented.,   Following his discharge from the hospital with a back injury Grover Hord developed paralysis in both legs and severe lower back pain. He was later diagnosed with a spinal fracture at T11 with associated spinal cord injuries.    Hord argued that the injuries and complications are permanent in nature including bowel and bladder incontinence. He underwent surgery in an attempt to repair the damage.    Grover Hord claimed great pain and a loss of enjoyment of life. His wife Jean Hord sought damages for loss of society companionship comfort love and solace.    Defendants disputed injury causation.

McCarty,On Nov. 11; 2011; plaintiff John Chiarle; 58; a construction laborer/handyman; and his nephew were operating landscaping equipment outside of rental duplexes. While using an industrial mower; Chiarle became pinned between the mower and a car. Tenant Tara Lavery was in the driver's seat of the vehicle at the time of the incident. Chiarle claimed abdominal; shoulder and knee injuries as a result of the incident.    Chiarle filed suit against Tara Lavery for motor vehicle negligence. He also sued Grace A. Lavery; who owned the vehicle in question; as well as his underinsured motorist carrier; State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company. State Farm was also named for subrogation purposes; as it had provided med pay for Chiarle.    Chiarle alleged that Tara Lavery drove up to her unit while he was performing the landscaping work and that he asked her to park elsewhere so he could mow the grass. He argued that Lavery backed the vehicle out of the driveway and pinned him against the mower. Chiarle asserted that Lavery failed to keep a proper lookout when backing the vehicle and was negligent.    Tara Lavery denied negligence. She contended that she pulled into the driveway across from her unit and that Chiarle; who was removing the mower from his work truck along a ramp; backed into her car and pinned himself.    At trial; Lavery noted for the jury that Chiarle's nephew was a witness to the accident; but did not appear for trial. She also argued that Chiarle had morphine in his system at the time of the accident due to unrelated health problems.    Prior to trial; the parties agreed that State Farm would be bound by the outcome of the jury verdict and State Farm offered to waive its $10;000 medical lien.,   Chiarle sought emergency treatment for complaints of abdominal pain. He later claimed shoulder and knee pain as well and was diagnosed with a left labrum tear and a meniscal tear. Chiarle underwent surgical repair for the shoulder and knee injuries.    Chiarle claimed $63000 in medical expenses ($47000 per Robinson v. Bates). He also sought damages for pain and suffering.    Defendants contended that Chiarle did not suffer any significant injuries and noted that he had no complaints of knee or shoulder pain at the emergency room immediately after the accident. As a result they argued that the surgeries were unrelated to the underlying incident.,1/1/2015,1,1,2015,0

United Ohio; which provided uninsured motorist coverage on the tow truck in the amount of $1 million; was named in the event the John Doe driver was not identified.    With regard to RDP Foodservice; Fosco claimed that; immediately before the crash; he recalled seeing an RDP Foodservice truck; driven by a black man. Fosco asserted that it was possible the RDP employee was the person who struck him; although he was unable to state this with absolute certainty.    Defendants contended that Fosco failed to provide proof of impact or who the driver was that allegedly hit him. Defendants contended that Fosco's tow truck did not show any significant signs of impact. Also; defendants asserted that; although Fosco testified that the tow truck's door was open; there was no apparent damage to the door or side mirror.    In the event an accident did occur; RDP acknowledged that it had a truck in the area at the time of the alleged crash and that it was being driven by a black man. However; RDP denied that its driver was the person who allegedly struck Fosco. Also; defendants argued that Fosco was negligent and the sole cause of the alleged accident and/or was comparatively negligent.,   Fosco was transported via EMS to a local emergency room for complaints of head neck back and knee pain. He followed up with his primary care physician and a chiropractor.    Fosco claimed $39569.43 in medical expense and $9500 ($500/week for 19 weeks) in lost wages as well as damages for pain and suffering.

Weaver claimed another $41123.89 was outstanding.    Defendant disputed injury causation and argued that Weaver had told the investigating officer he was not injured and EMS was not called to the scene. Defendant contended that Weaver had pre-existing problems with both shoulders and noted that Weaver continued to work as a handyman from the time of the accident until the time of his surgery. Defendant also argued that Weaver had been treating with his chiropractor for 20 years prior to this accident.    Defendant suggested that the jury award $916 in chiropractic expenses and $500 for pain and suffering.,6/1/2014,6,1,2014,0

Thomas Pukys,89,Motor Vehicle,blue,Motor Vehicle - Lane Change - Motor Vehicle - Rear-ender - Motor Vehicle,Case No. 2013-CV-01395,Loss of Consortium - Knee - Loss of Services - Meniscus - Tear,2500,low,Ohio,Stark County, Court of Common Pleas,NA,On June 14; 2010; at approximately 5 p.m.; plaintiff Lori Lytle; 49; was a front-seat passenger in a vehicle driven by her husband; Donald Lee Lytle. They were traveling west in the left lane of State Route 173 in Alliance. Thomas Pukys; who was also traveling west on 173; moved his vehicle from the right lane into the left lane in front of the Lytles' vehicle. Mr. Lytle then bumped the rear of Pukys' car. There were no injuries reported at the scene and neither vehicle sustained any significant damage. However; Mrs. Lytle subsequently sought treatment for a knee injury.    The Lytles sued Pukys for motor vehicle negligence. They alleged that Pukys was responsible for the accident.    According to plaintiffs; Pukys drove past their vehicle and; after signaling his intent to change lanes; moved into the left lane directly in front of their vehicle. They claimed Pukys failed to leave sufficient room between the vehicles when making the lane change; thereby cutting off their assured clear distance.    Pukys disputed liability. He contended that Mr. Lytle's own negligence caused and/or contributed to the collision.,   Lori Lytle claimed a re-tear of the meniscus in her left knee. She did not seek immediate medical attention but presented to the emergency room at Alliance Community Hospital the day after the accident. She was evaluated for knee pain.    Lytle who had undergone previous knee surgery subsequently treated with orthopedist Mark Shepard M.D. Based on her description of new pain Dr. Shepard determined that Lytle had re-injured her left knee in the collision.    Donald Lee Lytle asserted a loss of consortium claim. He claimed he was deprived of his wife's comfort society and companionship as a result of the knee injury.    Pukys denied Mrs. Lytle suffered any new injury and noted that the impact was insufficient to have caused any injury. The defense argued that Lytle had a significant pre-existing left knee condition. Pukys contended that Lytle she had undergone two surgeries since 2006 and received numerous post-surgical injections to address ongoing pain and difficulties walking including a series of injections less than one month prior to the collision.    Defense counsel further argued that the physical examination performed by the emergency room physician the day after the collision revealed no evidence of bruising swelling or other acute injury that would be associated with a torn meniscus. Instead the defense asserted that the exam revealed that the left knee had active full range of motion normal muscle strength and no sensory deficit.,4/1/2014,4,1,2014,0

Gilbert claimed a hip injury for which she required a hip replacement.    Oliver had complaints of neck and back pain. He was diagnosed with an annular tear of the lumbar spine following an MRI. He sought chiropractic treatment for his injuries three weeks post-accident. Oliver had ongoing complaints for which he treated until Sept. 2008 when he was involved in a serious motorcycle accident.    Oliver sought $16000 in medicals including $13000 for chiropractic services. He also sought damages for pain and suffering to the date of the motorcycle accident.    Defendant contended that Oliver's injuries should have resolved in a short period of time. Defendant also argued that Oliver exaggerated his symptoms and that his treatment was excessive.,4/1/2014,4,1,2014,0

She was traveling eastbound on Valley Parkway and entered the intersection with US Route 42 in Strongsville on a green light. Upon entering the intersection; she was struck by a vehicle driven by defendant Brian White and owned by defendant Deborah Kuntz. The force of the impact caused Thornton's car to overturn. The vehicle landed upside down in the roadway. A Strongsville police officer; Michael Biolglow; was monitoring traffic at the intersection and observed the collision. The officer cited White for running a red light.    Amanda Thornton and Donald Thornton sued White for motor vehicle negligence. They alleged that White failed to obey a red traffic signal and was driving in excess of the posted speed limit. They also sued Kuntz for negligent entrustment. Donald Thornton was seeking pecuniary loss for damage to his motor vehicle.    Defendant White admitted liability prior to trial and Kuntz was dismissed from the case.

She was extracted from her vehicle by paramedics and transported by ambulance to Southwest General Hospital. Thornton was evaluated in the emergency room for lacerations and trauma. She was diagnosed with a lateral tear of the left hip and contusions to her hip and lower back.    Thornton underwent extensive physical therapy and required sleep medication and anti-inflammatory medication for back pain. She was ultimately diagnosed with chronic trochanteric bursitis of the left hip and claimed ongoing hip and back pain. An orthopedist opined that the hip and back injuries were permanent which would result in ongoing treatment in the form of medication therapeutic exercise and restriction of activities.    Amanda Thornton sought damages of $14000 for past medical expenses and compensation for her past present and future pain and suffering. Donald Thornton sought pecuniary loss for damage to his vehicle.    Defendant White disputed damages.,3/1/2014,3,1,2014,0

Duhart,On March 13; 2011; plaintiff Barbara J. Williams; 45; an assembly line worker; was operating a pickup truck. Defendant Benjamin Berfield; who was also operating a pickup truck; entered the roadway in front of Williams' oncoming vehicle; resulting in a collision. Williams was then involved in a separate accident on March 25; 2011; which occurred when her vehicle was rear-ended by a car driven by defendant David Scott. The impact of the second accident was described as minor. Williams claimed neck and shoulder injuries as a result of the first accident; which she claimed were aggravated by the second accident.    Williams filed suit against Berfield and Scott. She alleged that Berfield was negligent in failing to yield the right-of-way and failing to keep a proper lookout when entering the roadway. She also alleged that Scott was negligent in failing to keep a proper lookout and maintain an assured clear distance ahead.    Both defendants admitted responsibility for causing their respective accidents; but disputed injury causation.,   Williams did not seek emergency treatment after either accident. In between the two incidents Williams made two visits to a chiropractor with complaints of neck and shoulder pain. Following the second accident she sought medical treatment and ultimately underwent arthroscopic surgery for nerve impingement in the shoulder. During that surgery it was discovered that the rotator cuff was torn but no repair was done.    Plaintiff claimed in excess of $40000 in medicals. She also sought damages for unspecified lost wages and pain and suffering.    Defendant Berfield acknowledged that Williams may have sustained a minor neck sprain in the first accident but argued that the injury should have resolved in a short period of time. He also argued that Williams' shoulder complaints pre-existed the accident and were unrelated.    Defendant Scott maintained that Williams was not injured in the second accident based on the minor nature of the collision. Scott relied on photographs showing that there was no damage to Williams' vehicle and that the only damage to his vehicle was that the license plate fell off.,3/1/2014,3,1,2014,0

He was ultimately diagnosed with a torn rotator cuff for which he required surgery. He claimed ongoing residuals. Ryan claimed he was unable to continue operating his business as a result of these injuries and was forced to retire.    Stegall contended that Ryan was not injured in this accident. Stegall argued that any continuing problems were due to extensive co-morbidities including three prior heart attacks chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) diabetes congestive heart failure knee problems and morbid obesity. Also Stegall argued that Ryan's retirement was likely caused by his other medical conditions and not by any minor injuries he may have sustained in this accident. Further Stegall contended there was no objective medical evidence of residuals.,3/1/2014,3,1,2014,0

Peters suffered a torn labrum in his left shoulder; for which he underwent arthroscopic surgery. He was also diagnosed with a cervical disc herniation and other shoulder injuries.    Peters sued Abusada for motor vehicle negligence. He alleged that Abusada failed to maintain an assured clear distance ahead and was responsible for the collision. United Healthcare was named as an involuntary plaintiff for subrogation purposes.    Abusada admitted liability; but disputed proximate cause.,   Peters presented to a neurological surgeon one week post-accident with complaints of neck pain. An MRI on Sept. 19 2011 revealed a right-sided disc herniation at the C5-C6 level with no significant nerve impingement. Peters was told he was not a candidate for surgery based on the lack of lesions correlating to the pattern of pain complaints.    Peters' personal physician Mark Schirkendantz M.D. testified at deposition that the MRI also showed mild tendinosis of the rotator cuff and tearing in the labrum of the left shoulder. Peters underwent arthroscopic surgery on the left shoulder on Feb. 6 2012.    Peters was also diagnosed with adhesive capsulitis with a recommendation for continuation of physical therapy. His doctor also stated that the MRI showed a small partial tear of the biceps tendon and a partial tearing of the anterior supraspinatus tendon. He was diagnosed with synovitis and bursitis.    Peters claimed $56947.25 in past medicals and $8810.64 in lost wages.    Defendant contended that Peters had a pre-existing condition to the left shoulder and severe degenerative changes. Defendant argued that the need for surgery was due to the pre-existing problems with the shoulder. Defendant further argued that the impact was minimal and that the police report itself indicated no injuries were reported and cited little to no physical damage to the vehicles.,1/1/2014,1,1,2014,0

At the same time; defendant John Roe was operating a 2008 Ford Econoline E250 van eastbound on Homer Road. Roe reportedly failed to stop for a stop sign at the intersection of Homer Road and State Route 661; resulting in a collision with plaintiff's vehicle. Plaintiff claimed shoulder; neck and back injuries as a result of the impact.    Plaintiff Doe sued Roe and his employer for motor vehicle negligence. Plaintiff Ohio Health Corporation joined the suit for reimbursement of medical expenses paid on behalf of Doe.    Plaintiffs alleged that Roe was in the course and scope of his employment when he ran a stop sign and failed to yield the right-of-way. Plaintiffs also argued that the employer should have known its employee was incompetent and lacked the skill and qualifications to drive its vehicle. As a result; plaintiffs argued that the employer was vicariously liable.    Defendants did not dispute liability for this accident. The case proceeded on the issues of injury causation and damages.,   Doe required surgery to repair a rotator cuff tear and asserted that future surgery was anticipated. He also claimed soft tissue cervical and lumbar injuries. Doe alleged that his ability to perform his work as a mechanic was impeded as a result of the shoulder injury.    Defendants did not dispute that plaintiff might have suffered soft tissue neck back and shoulder injuries but argued that the rotator cuff injury might be related to a pre-existing degenerative condition.,12/1/2013,12,1,2013,0

While stopped for a stop sign at the intersection of Mitchell's and Route 9; Dennis was struck by a reversing vehicle operated by Cassidy Tubaugh. Dennis claimed an injury to his right wrist.    Dennis and his wife; Sandra Dennis; sued Tubaugh; alleging that he was negligent in the operation of his vehicle; causing the accident and Dennis' injuries.    Dennis contended that Tubaugh's reversing maneuver was sudden and unexpected.    Tubaugh contended that when he stopped for the stop sign; he was worried that his vehicle might be sticking too far out into the adjoining roadway and; consequently; he backed up his vehicle. He claimed that he then made contact with Dennis' vehicle immediately behind him; but that the very minor impact could best be described as a "tap."    Tubaugh did admit fault for the impact prior to trial; and the matter proceeded to a trial on damages only.,   Dennis first presented to his primary care doctor five weeks after the accident. He claimed a traumatic injury to his right dominant wrist which he alleged occurred when he was either moving his hand/arm to sound his horn and/or retracting his arm/hand from the horn to the gear shift in an attempt to back his vehicle up to avoid being struck by Tubaugh's reversing vehicle.    Dennis' injury was diagnosed as a scapholunate advanced collapse.

Sandra Dennis sought $5000 in damages for a loss of consortium. The plaintiffs asked the jury for a total award of roughly $86000.    Tubaugh disputed the plaintiffs' claims for injuries and damages. He contended that the low-impact nature of the accident as well as the five-week gap between the accident and Dennis' first doctor visit was a significant factor. Tubaugh further argued that Dennis did not have surgery on his wrist until more than three years after the accident.,12/1/2013,12,1,2013,0

He returned to work but claimed he has restrictions on lifting pushing standing and bending. One of his treating orthopedists Dr. Leonard Buck testified that Mehl will need a total knee replacement.    Mehl sought to recover damages for past and future medical costs and past and future pain and suffering. His counsel asked the jury to award $500000.    Defense counsel did not dispute Mehl's shoulder injury and acknowledged that it was caused by the accident. He did dispute his knee injury. The defense's expert orthopedist testified that Mehl's two knee surgeries and the need for a total knee replacement were not related to the motor vehicle accident. He attributed the injury to a degenerative condition. He noted that in 1995 Mehl underwent knee surgery to repair a torn patella. He testified that he had other tears in his knee as well as arthritis that became progressively worse over the years.,11/1/2013,11,1,2013,0

Hudson alleged that as she began decelerating her vehicle; in response to the slowing traffic ahead of her; the rear of her Jeep Cherokee was struck by the front of a Toyota 4Runner operated by Donald Brewer; who was traveling at 50 mph. The impact thrust Hudson's vehicle into the rear of a Jeep Liberty in front of her; resulting in a five-vehicle chain-reaction collision. Hudson claimed that she suffered strains and sprains to her neck; back and left ankle.    Hudson sued Brewer; alleging that he was negligent in the operation of his vehicle. Brewer had a policy limit of $100;000. Hudson also sued her insurer; Motorists Insurance Group; for an underinsured-motorist claim. Motorists Insurance agreed to be bound by the verdict and did not participate in the trial. Brewer stipulated to liability; and the case proceeded to trial on the issues of causation and damages.,   Hudson was taken by ambulance to an emergency room where she was examined and released 12 hours later. She followed up with her family physician who put her on a course of physical therapy which she underwent from Feb. 3 to Aug. 3 2010. She was diagnosed with strains and sprains to her cervical and lumbar spine and left ankle. Following the completion of her physical therapy Hudson continued to consult with her family doctor and was treated with pain medication up until trial. She sought to recover $43244.63 in past medical expenses.    Hudson's expert in orthopedic surgery opined that she suffered a peroneal-tendon rupture caused by the accident but in order for him to make a professional medical opinion further examination and tests were needed.    Hudson who was retired at the time of the accident claimed that her left ankle swells and she is in pain constantly which causes her to walk with a limp due to instability. She claimed that she can only walk a half-hour at a time before having to sit down to rest.    Hudson sought to recover $43244.63 in past medical expenses and unspecified amounts in non-economic damages for past and future pain and suffering and loss of life's enjoyment.    The defense's expert in orthopedic surgery opined that Hudson's condition was based upon the accident and prior conditions. According to the defense she had prior lower left leg problems and a prior left ankle injury in a previous accident. Moreover she had multiple diagnostic tests before and after the accident to her left ankle and all of those tests were negative for an acute injury maintained Brewer's counsel. While Hudson may have suffered some injury in the accident she had a pre-existing condition that was the cause of her ongoing problems asserted the defense.    Defense counsel argued that using the calculations set forth in the Ohio Supreme Court's holding of Robinson v. Bates Hudson's past medical costs amounted to $14267.69.,6/1/2013,6,1,2013,0

Collier,On Sept. 8; 2010; at 11:10 p.m.; plaintiff's decedent Keith Wetmore; 54; a dairy farmer; stopped his tractor in the middle of Bursley Road in Spencer. He stopped to retrieve a calf that had wandered off his nearby farm. At the same time; Alli Divincenzo; traveling at a speed of 50 mph in a 55-mph speed zone; came upon the tractor; which was pulling a front-end loader. Divincenzo swerved to avoid a collision and went into a ditch; just as Wetmore was coming out of the same ditch with the calf in his arms. The front of Divincenzo's vehicle struck Wetmore in the legs; amputating them below the knees. Wetmore bled to death moments later.    Wetmore's sister; Karen Bihn; as administratrix of Wetmore's estate; brought suit against Divincenzo. Plaintiff alleged that Divincenzo was driving while distracted and failed to notice the tractor ahead in her high beams. The estate's expert in visibility and discernibility concluded that; had Divincenzo been paying attention; she would have seen the tractor and adequately veered around it. The expert also faulted Divincenzo as an inexperienced driver. She was just 18 years old at the time of the accident and had only had her license for three months.    The defense faulted Wetmore for leaving his tractor unattended; with no lights activated; in the middle of the roadway. According to Divincenzo's expert in accident reconstruction; based upon the visibility and the speed in which Divincenzo was traveling; it was not possible for Divincenzo to have seen the tractor with enough time to safely veer around it. The expert faulted Wetmore for not parking his tractor in a grassy area -- located directly adjacent to where he parked his tractor in the roadway -- that led to his farm. Divincenzo also relied on the testimony of Wetmore's brother; who said that Wetmore often drove at night without lights activated; since it was a non-busy roadway.,   Keith Wetmore suffered the traumatic amputation of both legs and died due to exsanguination. The estate sought to recover $3180 for funeral bills and unspecified amounts in non-economic damages for adult beneficiaries.,1/1/2014,1,1,2014,0

Urbina did not drive; did own a car and did not have insurance.    Defendant Potter contended that she did not see Urbina; nor did she know what she had hit. She argued that Urbina was comparatively negligent. According to Potter; it was cold and very dark on the evening of the accident and Urbina was dressed in dark clothing and crossed at an unmarked crosswalk. Defendant argued that the nearest street lamp was out in the vicinity of the accident and that Urbina might have been using his cell phone at the time. Defendant asserted that Urbina was in a better position to avoid the accident because he could observe Potter's oncoming headlights along the one-way street.,   Luis Urbina died due to blunt force trauma.

McGrath,On March 8; 2008; Pauline J. Miller; 47; was traveling north on State Route 165 in Columbiana County. She was on her way to work at St. 18 a.m.; her vehicle was struck head-on by a box truck driven by Joseph Goscenski; Jr.; who had been traveling in the opposite direction of Miller. The accident reportedly occurred when Goscenski lost control of the truck after encountering a series of massive potholes in the roadway. Goscenski's truck then crossed over the center line and struck Miller's 1994 Dodge Intrepid. Miller died from the massive injuries sustained in the crash.    Miller's husband; Dennis D. Miller; individually and as administrator of his wife's estate; filed this wrongful death lawsuit against the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT).    Plaintiff alleged that that the ODOT had a duty to maintain the roadway in a reasonably safe manner and that it failed to repair the potholes on State Route 165; despite knowledge of the unsafe condition. Plaintiff further argued that the ODOT's failure to repair the potholes was the sole proximate cause of a collision that resulted in the decedent's wrongful death.    There was testimony from a nearby resident who claimed to have reported the potholes to the ODOT several weeks before the accident. Also; an ODOT supervisor confirmed he had seen the potholes two days before the accident. The supervisor admitted that he had suggested patching the holes; but noted the holes were not in need of immediate repair.    Plaintiff filed a separate lawsuit against Goscenski; but Goscenski settled with the plaintiff prior to trial for an undisclosed sum. The claims against the ODOT proceeded to trial; with the issues of liability and damages bifurcated.    The ODOT denied liability. It contended that had no knowledge or notice of the precise condition of the potholes. Alternatively; ODOT argued that; even if it had notice of the potholes; Miller's death was caused by Goscenski's negligence; not the condition of the road.,   Miller was survived by her husband and two adult children who sought recovery of wrongful death damages including future loss of earnings loss of household services her husband's loss of society and mental anguish and the children's loss of consortium. Plaintiff offered numerous witnesses as to the non-economic losses resulting from Miller's death as well as the opinion of an economist regarding the estimated loss of future earnings.    Defendant argued that plaintiff's estimate of damages was excessive and based upon unreliable and biased sources.,1/1/2013,1,1,2013,0

ABF Freight Systems; Inc.; et al. v. Louis Grzely; Administrator of the Estate of Thomas Grzely; et al.,135,Wrongful Death,blue,Auto/truck Accident - Interstate - Alcohol,Case No. CV-10-725505,Wrongful Death,0,low,Ohio,Cuyahoga County, Court of Common Pleas,Christine T. McMonagle,A Cuyahoga County jury returned a defense verdict in this wrongful death case. The case went to trial on counterclaims of the decedent's estate. The jury found that the defendant truck driver was negligent for speeding; but did not believe his speed was the proximate cause of the decedent's death.    In the early morning hours of October 7; 2009; Thomas Grzely entered westbound I-480. There was a brief; but heavy; rainstorm around this time. Grzely lost control of his vehicle on the entrance ramp and struck the median and/or guardrails. His vehicle then came to a stop in the far right lane of travel near the entrance ramp. Grzely exited his vehicle and was standing near the driver's side door when the back of his disabled vehicle was struck by a 40;000 pound semi driven by Gary Burch and owned by ABF Systems; Inc. The semi was hauling two trailers. The impact; which occurred at an approximate speed of 60 mph in a 55 mph speed zone for commercial vehicles; pushed the vehicle into Grzely's person. Grzely was thrown 200' from the point of impact and died as a result of his injuries.    This lawsuit was initiated against Grzely's estate by ABF; which sought reimbursement for the property damage ($42;605) to its truck. The estate counterclaimed against ABF and Burch for wrongful death. ABF dismissed its complaint and cause of action on the morning of trial and the case proceeded on the estate's claims.    Counter-plaintiff alleged that Burch was speeding and should have been able to stop in time to avoid the accident; or at least swerve around the disabled vehicle. ABF and Burch contended that Grzely was highly intoxicated (he had a BAC of .12 two hours after the crash) and speculated that he got onto the wrong roadway while attempting to drive home from a bar. ABF and Burch argued that Grzely exited the vehicle after retrieving personal items; but never activated the emergency flashers to warn approaching drivers of the disabled vehicle. They claimed Grzely's car was not visible until approximately 5' before the crash. They also argued that Burch's speed of 60 mph on an interstate highway was reasonable. Burch's speed at the time of impact was confirmed by the black box recovered from the truck.    The only witness to the event passed ABF's truck shortly before the accident and barely missed striking Grzely's disabled vehicle. The witness reportedly saw the truck lights and another set of lights in the rearview mirror shortly before the truck impacted with Grzely's vehicle. The witness confirmed that Grzely had not activated his emergency flashers and that the headlights on Grzely's vehicle were dim.    Decedent was a 44-year-old divorced male who worked as a mechanic for a Honda dealership.,   Blunt force trauma resulting in death. Decedent may have had 15 minutes of conscious survival time but died several hours later. He was survived by his parents and a brother.,11/1/2011,11,1,2011,0
Craig Tiscareno and Teresa Tiscareno v. Progressive West Insurance Company; an Ohio Corporation,136,Wrongful Death,red,Parents of Son Killed in Crash carrier acted in bad faith. Insurance - Bad Faith - Motor Vehicle - Automobile Insurance,308-cv-00180-H-CAB,Wrongful Death,890945,high,California,NA,United States District Court - Southern District,Marilyn L. Huff,On Jan. 5; 2007; at about 9:40 p.m.; plaintiffs' decedent Joshua Tiscareno; 29; stopped his vehicle on eastbound Athena Street in Encinitas. As he began to make a left turn across southbound Highway 101; a pickup truck being operated by 16-year-old Kody Porterfield broadsided his vehicle.    Kody had only been driving for about 4 months and had a provisional driving license. At the time of the accident; he was traveling at about 85 miles per hour in a 40-mph zone. The crash resulted in Tiscareno's death.    Tiscareno's parents; Craig Tiscareno and Teresa Tiscareno; filed a complaint for wrongful death against Kody's parents; who allegedly allowed Kody to drive the vehicle; and; on April 16; 2007; made a written policy limit settlement demand. The Porterfields' insurance carrier; Progressive West Insurance Co.; responded; stating; "We are unable to accept or reject your demand for policy limits" and that they needed more time to complete their investigation. In addition; the carrier stated that its investigation determined that; "primary responsibility would rest with Mr. Joshua Tiscareno as a result of his failure to yield the right of way." The Tiscarenos again made a demand for the policy limits; but Progressive refused to accept it stating they had not completed their investigation. After 32 days; the Tiscarenos withdrew their policy limit demand.    During the wrongful death case; depositions were taken of Joshua Tiscareno's parents and Progressive offered to tender its $100;000 policy limit; but it was rejected. On Feb. 1; 2008; with the consent of Progressive; a stipulated judgment in the amount of $750;000 was entered against the Porterfield family who; in return for a covenant not to execute; assigned their rights against Progressive to the Tiscarenos for any claims they may have against the carrier for its failure to accept the April 16; 2007; policy limits demand. As part of the stipulated judgment; Progressive paid the $100;000 limits to the Tiscarenos.    On Jan. 29; 2008; Progressive filed a declaratory relief action seeking a declaration that its decision to neither accept nor reject the Tiscarenos' unsupported April 2007 policy limits demand was reasonable.    The Tiscarenos brought a counterclaim against Progressive; alleging bad faith.    The court ultimately severed the Tiscarenos' bad faith counterclaim action and it went to trial with the sole issue being whether Progressive unreasonably failed to accept a reasonable settlement demand for an amount within policy limits between the time it was made on April 16; 2007 and the time it was withdrawn on May 18; 2007.    The Tiscarenos' counsel presented evidence that at the time the offer was made; it was clear that liability was primarily against the insured; the death certificate and other evidence established that the plaintiffs were the legal heirs of the deceased; and numerous witnesses who could provide information regarding the relationship between the Tiscarenos and their son had been identified but were never contacted by Progressive. Counsel noted that on the morning after the accident; and for days thereafter; local newspapers published information about the accident after they interviewed investigating officers. According to the articles; the officers stated that Kody "didn't sugar coat" the facts and admitted he was going 85 mph; as well as admitted that he had an underage minor in the car with him. The newspaper articles and the information available also showed that Kody was potentially facing felony manslaughter charges; and listed the names of numerous people who knew the Tiscarenos. According to plaintiffs' counsel; Progressive obtained some of the articles during its investigation; but failed to contact any witnesses identified in the articles. In addition; plaintiffs' counsel contended that; on Jan. 18; 2007; Progressive took Kody's recorded statement; in which he again admitted he was driving approximately 85 mph; and raised its reserves to $100;000; but still failed to tender the policy limit.    Defense counsel presented evidence that Progressive was unable to pay the policy limits when the demand was made because it needed more time to complete its investigation. Counsel contended that the accident was immediately reported to Progressive by Kody's parents and that the carrier had conducted a scene investigation within days of the incident. Counsel also contended that upon an initial investigation; Progressive reserved the full policy limits; and attempted to talk to the investigating officer to discuss the accident and to obtain the police report. However; Progressive claimed that the investigating office would not return phone calls and that it was told the police report would not be available for several months.    Defense counsel argued that Progressive encountered some difficulty in its attempts to contact the independent witnesses who could testify about the relationship between the parents and their deceased son. Progressive claimed that it was able to take a statement from Kody; but that the parents of Kody's teenage passenger would not let it talk to her. The carrier also claimed that it did not want to upset Joshua Tiscareno's parents; so it asked the police and the decedent's employer to tell the Tiscarenos that Progressive wanted to talk to them about Joshua's relationship with them so it could settle the claim. However; Progressive claimed that the police officer would not return its call and the employer refused. The carrier alleged that it then called Craig Tiscareno's business and left a message; but that it received a response from the Tiscarenos' lawyer who directed all communication should be directed to him. As a result; Progressive claimed that it asked the Tiscarenos' lawyer to provide some basic information to determine Joshua's heirs and to provide some information about the relationship so that it could settle the claim; but that there was no response. Progressive claimed that it again wrote the lawyer asking for some basic information to determine the nature of the relationship between Joshua and his parents; and again received no response. It claimed that; instead; the Tiscarenos' counsel; without telling Progressive; filed and served a lawsuit; and then demanded that the policy limits be paid immediately. Progressive claimed that due to the problems it encountered; it asked for time to get the information it requested; but that the Tiscarenos' counsel refused and again demanded payment of the policy limits immediately. It contended that when defense counsel for the Porterfields asked for more time and the information that was requested; the Tiscarenos' lawyer considered this request to be a rejection. In addition; Progressive's counsel argued that because the Tiscarenos' demand lacked an offer to release the insureds from liability; there was no breach of the implied covenant in not accepting it. Counsel contended that it cannot be liable for failure to accept the Tiscarenos' policy limits demand because it was inadequate and their former attorney persistently failed to provide Progressive with the information it needed to conduct its investigation; including explaining the relationship Craig and Teresa Tiscareno had with their son.,   The Tiscarenos sought recovery of $650000 the amount remaining on the $750000 stipulated judgment entered against the insured in the underlying wrongful death matter plus legal interest.,10/1/2011,10,1,2011,0

Metz,A pedestrian suffered fatal injuries when he was struck by a car driven by the defendant; who denied liability for the accident. The parties stipulated to $250;000 in damages and the case went before a Hamilton County judge for a determination of liability only. The court found the defendant was liable and a $250;000 judgment was entered for the plaintiff.    Plaintiff's decedent; William Johnson; was attempting to cross Madison Avenue 48 a.m. on December 4; 2008. The street was dimly lit and the roadway was damp from an earlier rain shower. Johnson attempted to cross the street in the middle of the block; where there was a crosswalk with a flashing yellow light; but was struck by a vehicle driven by Defendant Daniel Albers. Johnson died of injuries sustained in the impact.    Plaintiff alleged that Johnson was in the crosswalk and had determined he had enough time to safely cross the street; but defendant was speeding and failed to yield the right-of-way. Defendant denied he was speeding and claimed that Johnson's steel shoe left a gouge mark in the pavement; which was outside the crosswalk; when he was struck. Defendant further asserted that he was unable to see Johnson in the darkness.    Plaintiff's decedent was a 65-year-old single male who was retired.,   Blunt force trauma resulting in death.,9/1/2011,9,1,2011,0

Forsling,In the early hours of March 2; 2007; Defendant Bluffton University's baseball team from Ohio was traveling to Sarasota; Florida; for a tournament. The bus was on I-75 near Atlanta in the HOV lane when the driver; defendant's decedent; Jerome Niemeyer; accidentally exited at Northside Drive; apparently not realizing he was on the off-ramp. The chartered bus hurtled through a stop sign at the top of the ramp. The bus crashed over a concrete barrier and through a chain-link fence onto the highway below. Seven people were killed; including the driver and his spouse; who was a passenger. The charter bus was owned by Defendant Executive Coach Luxury Travel; Inc. Claims by plaintiffs against all [*3] defendants were ultimately combined into a multicase suit. In 2008; Executive Coach and Niemeyer's estate agreed to pay $ 5;000;000. Claims against Defendant Georgia Department of Transportation for negligent design of the interstate exit were settled for $ 3;000;000 (liability limits) in 2009. Plaintiffs pursued Bluffton University for its insurance coverage on the basis that the driver was covered under its policies. Plaintiffs argued that; because Bluffton hired Niemeyer through Executive Coach and because he was driving the bus with the school's permission; he qualified for coverage under the terms of Bluffton's policy with Hartford Fire Insurance ($ 1;000;000 limits). Bluffton's other two policies with American Alternative Insurance ($ 5;000;000 limits) and an excess coverage policy with Federal Insurance ($ 15;000;000 limits) were bound by the terms of Hartford's policy. American Alternative and Federal challenged the interpretation. After extended litigation and appeals; the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that; under the plain terms of the Hartford policy; Niemeyer was covered; and the omnibus coverage of the o,,6/1/2595,6,1,695,1

Defendant companies had disputed responsibility for the actions of the driver of the logging truck.    Plaintiff's decedent; Joey D. Wiseman; was traveling east on Route 82 at 00 p.m. on May 27; 2008. Defendant Timothy Yerian was backing a semi tractor-trailer across the eastbound lane. The rig of defendant's semi was in the westbound lane and was facing plaintiff's vehicle. The bright lights were activated on the semi tractor-trailer. Decedent drove his vehicle into the tandem wheels of the trailer without slowing or swerving. He died shortly after the state patrol arrived at the accident scene. Yerian was operating a tractor-trailer for Defendants Berlin Lumber; LLC and RTM Transport; LLC.    Plaintiff alleged that Berlin and RTM engaged the services of Yerian to pick up logs at a site on State Route 82 and deliver them to the lumber yard. Plaintiff maintained that Yerian used a trailer and loading equipment owned by defendant companies. Plaintiff argued that defendants were negligent in allowing Yerian to load the trailer at night; when it would be more dangerous to other motorists. Plaintiff asserted that Yerian did not use flares; lights or a flagman while loading the logs. Plaintiff argued that that defendants were aware Yerian was loading the logs at night; due to the time he was bringing the loads to the lumber yard.    Defendants contended that Yerian was an independent contractor. Berlin and RTM maintained that their drivers were given safety training and had been instructed not to go to this particular site at night.    Plaintiff's decedent was a male in his 30s who was employed as a security guard.,,4/1/2011,4,1,2011,0

Plaintiff alleged defendant cab company should not have dispatched the cab to the address because there had already been an issue with the same address earlier that night. Defendant contended that it had nothing to do with decedent's unfortunate death.

Their estates filed this lawsuit against two truck drivers and the truck drivers' employers; all of whom denied liability. Plaintiffs reached a settlement of $4;625;000 with Defendants Darling International; Inc. and James B. Holland.    Margaret Patton was driving a small Mazda with her son; Schuyler Wood; as a front seat passenger on August 3; 2005. They were traveling eastbound on I-70 and were on their way from Indiana to Columbus to meet Margaret's sister for a family reunion. They stopped near mile marker 52 due to an accident. The accident involved a large truck and trailer driven by Defendant Frederick Woods in the scope of his employment with Defendant Undercar Specialty Warehouse. According to the Ohio State Highway Patrol report; Frederick Woods struck the rear of a tractor-trailer; which then struck the rear of a third vehicle. The impact resulted in Frederick Woods' truck and trailer becoming disabled in the roadway and partially jackknifed. While stopped behind the trailer; the Patton vehicle was rear-ended by a tanker truck operated by Holland; who was in the course of his employment with Darling International; Inc. The impact speed was approximately 65 mph. Holland's truck drove over the back and top of the Patton vehicle; which; along with Holland's tanker truck; then collided with Frederick Woods' trailer. The gas tank on the Mazda ruptured and all three vehicles became engulfed in flames. The severity of the impact dislodged Frederick Woods' truck from the trailer and shot the truck off the right side of the roadway. Holland; who was not wearing a seat belt; was ejected from his tractor on impact and sustained moderate injuries. Patton and her son were trapped in their vehicle with no means of escape and died. The fire was so intense that emergency responders were not aware there was a passenger vehicle involved in the crash until after the fire was brought under control.    Plaintiffs alleged that both defendant drivers were negligent and their actions contributed to the untimely deaths of Patton and her son. Plaintiffs also alleged that defendant employers were vicariously liable for their employees' actions.    Defendants Darling International and Holland contended that the accident was the result of the other defendants' negligence. They filed a crossclaim against Undercar and Woods; who denied they were responsible for the wrongful deaths of Patton and her son.    Decedent Margaret was 45-year-old divorced female who was a school teacher.
